        <h1>History & Key Figures of Samoa</h1>
    
        <p>The history of Samoa's journey to independence through external influences and internal struggles for self-determination. Back in the late 1800s, European powers like Germany, Britain, and the U.S. wanted control of Samoa because of its strategic spot in the Pacific. At first, Britain controlled the islands, but by the end of the century, Samoa was split between Germany and the U.S. And later, the 1899 Treaty of Berlin officially divided the islands, with the U.S. taking control of the eastern islands (now known as American Samoa) and Germany getting the western ones (which later became a New Zealand territory after World War I).</p>

        <br>

        <p>Samoa's path to independence was shaped by the rise of the Mau Movement in the 1920s, a non-violent campaign seeking greater autonomy from New Zealand rule. The Mau gained momentum, particularly after the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed a significant portion of the population. The movement, led by figures like Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, faced violent repression, including the killing of Tamasese by New Zealand forces in 1929. Despite this, the movement persisted, and Samoa eventually gained independence in 1962, becoming the first Pacific nation to do so.</p>

        <p>In contrast, American Samoa remained a U.S. territory. Despite its political status, the Samoan people maintained their traditional way of life, and in the 20th century, American Samoa adopted its own constitution in 1967 and elected its first governor in 1977. The division of the Samoan islands into two politically distinct entities reflects Samoa's complex colonial history and the continued cultural connections between the regions.</p>

        <p>Key figures in Samoa's history include leaders like Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, whose sacrifice symbolizes the fight for independence. Other influential figures include Prime Minister Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II, who played a crucial role in Samoa's post-independence development. Their leadership has left an enduring legacy in shaping the nation's identity.</p>
