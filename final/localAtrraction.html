                    "Sauniatu Waterfalls is honestly one of the most beautiful places to swim in Upolu! It's a spot that I feel is only known by locals or members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I think it's a must-visit for anyone seeking peace and nature."

                <blockquote>
                    "Only a few people know that the very author of Treasure Island - Robert Louis Stevenson lived his last days in Samoa. And to this day his name is known across Samoa. His house was later turned into a museum, that I believe is quite fascinating. So I think a place that people should visit on a slow day would be the Robert Louis Stevenson Museum."
