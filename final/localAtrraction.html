                    <h3>The village of Sauniatu</h3>
                    "Found in the village of Sauniatu there is a beautiful compound that is well kept by the members of the Church of Jesus Christ. There is a few basketball courts, a big grass area where you can play field games, a campsite with showers, many faleo'o and more as well as a waterfall and nearby rivers. My family and I love going there on a hot day to swim, play and enjoy the scenery and cleanliness. Also, not far from outside the compound is a momument made of stone with a plaque that commemorates President David O. McKay's blessing on the village of Sauniatu and its people."

                    <h3>Chillz</h3>
                    "There's an ice cream and food joint that my family and I found on our way to meet some family friends in Fagalii. I think it's in Togafuafua. It's very affordable, the food is made fresh and it has amazing real fruit ice-cream. I go there at least once or twice a month. I think bigger company's like Uncle Johnny's or well known shops like Scoops over shine Chillz. It's truly underrated and I believe their business deserves more recognition and customers."

                    <h3>The village of Falealupo</h3>
                    "The village named Falealupo is a place I believe would be an amazing for tourists that want to learn about more about stories and legends. If I remember correctly then if you ask a local, that villager will basically give you a tour of the areas in the village and tell you stories of old that happened in that specific part."

                    <h3>Bella's</h3>
                    "Many people know of Bella's Kitchen as the restaurant has begun to make a name for itself in Upolu amongst both locals and foreigners. However, close to the Apia Park, in the front of a hotel named Samoana Boutique there is a little cafe called Bella's inside the open area that the hotel's reception office is. I think it's not well known due to the hotel's awkward location but let me tell you, it's worth it. They have an all you can eat salad bar, amazingly cooked meat and beautifully made shakes".
