    <header><h1>Final Project Proposal</h1></header>

    <main>
        <p><strong>The title and topic of your site</strong></p>
        
        <p><em><strong>Title</strong></em> - Fa'a SƒÅmoa: The Samoan Way of Life</p>
        <p><em><strong>Reason:</strong></em> Because I'm a New Zealand born Samoan and after living in Samoa for a few years I learnt so much about the history, culture and how different topics and ideas about Samoa are not talked about enough.</p>

        <br>

        <p><strong>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</strong></p>
        <ol>
            
            <li><em><strong>Homepage</strong></em>: It'll just have the title, navigation links to the other pages, an introduction of Samoa and a brief overview of the topics that'll be on the other pages.</li>
        

            <li><em><strong>Samoan History & Key Figures</strong></em>: Information on this page will include events that led to the Independence of Samoa like how the country was once under Germany, then the the British, then New Zealand and more. Also talk about significant people and places like Malietoa Tanumafili II and Vaimoso.</li>

            <li><em><strong>Church & Religion</strong></em>: This page will discuss how religion plays a huge role in Samoa as a whole. God is a very important part of the motto "Faavae i le Atua Samoa" which translates to "God be the Foundation of Samoa" and it is featured on the country's coat of arms. Religion plays a huge role in traditional beliefs and society today.</li>

            <li><em><strong>Samoa's Global Impact</strong></em> This page will talk about how the Samoan population outside of Samoa exceeds the population of Samoans within the country itself. Also talk about how Samoans have quite an impact within the South Pacific as well as in the rest disapora. Maybe even speak on how some Samoan representation have influenced masses in different areas like the media (e.g. Uso Brothers, The Rock, Parris Goebel etc.).</li>

            <li><em><strong>Tourist Attractions</strong></em> This might end up being the last page, I don't know yet. I'll highlight some of Samoa's landmarks like Mount Vaea, Robert Louis Stevenson Museum etc. This page will include a table of commonly visited tourist attractions as well as activities that they can visit to become immersed in the Samoan culture.</li>

            <li><em><strong>Local Attractions</strong></em> In this page I'm planning on interviewing Samoa born or individuals that lived in Samoa for a significant amount of time. I hope to include information such as places and activities many people dont know of or are overlooked by many due to the push of only tourist attractions that are just as beautiful, if not more.

        <p><strong>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</strong></p>
        <p>= Websites I plan to use are news that focuses on the Pacific or Samoa in specific like Tagata Pasifika or Samoan Observer. I will also use other online resources like official website for Samoa Tourism Authority and Britannica. I plan to conduct interviews with my family and friends that currently live in Samoa for any information that may not be available on the internet. I will also use my own photos from when I lived in Samoa.</p>
