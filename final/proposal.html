    <header><h1>Final Project Proposal</h1></header>

    <main>
        <p>Title: Fa'a SƒÅmoa: The Samoan Way of Life</p>
        
        <p>Reason: Because I'm a New Zealand born Samoan and after living in Samoa for a few years I learnt so much about the history, culture and how different certain topics about Samoa are not talked about enough.</p>

        <p>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</p>
        <p>Homepage: It'll just have the links to the five pages, an introduction of Samoa and a brief overview of the other topics that'll be on the other pages.</p>

            <p>1. Samoan History & Key Figures</p>
            <p>= Information on this page will include events that led to the Independence of Samoa like how the country was once under Germany, then the the British, then New Zealand and so on. Also talk about significant people like Malietoa Tanumafili II.</p>
            

            <p>2. Samoan Church & Religion</p>
            <p>= Discuss how religion plays a huge role in Samoa as a whole that God is a part of the motto "Faavae i le Atua Samoa" which translates to "God be the Foundation og Samoa" and it is featured on the countr's coat of arms. Religion plays a huge role in traditional beliefs and society today.</p>


            <p>3. Samoan Global Impact</p>
            <p>= This page will talk about how the Samoan population outside of Samoa exceeds the population of Samoans within the country itself. Also talk about how Samoans have quite an impact within the South Pacific as well as in the rest disapora. Maybe even speak on how some Samoan representation have influenced masses in different areas like the media (e.g. Uso Brothers, The Rock, Parris Goebel etc.).</p>


            <p>4. Tourist Attractions</p>
            <p>= This might end up being the last page, I don't know yet. This page will include a table of commonly visited tourist attractions as well as activities that they can visit to become immersed in the Samoan culture.</p>

            <p>5. Local opinion</p>
            <p>= In this page I'm planning on interviewing Samoa born individuals on what places many people dont know of or are overlooked by many due to the push of only tourist attractions that are just as beautiful, if not more. (Hidden gems)</p>


        <p>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</p>
        <p>Form = Name, email, what is a place you want to visit because of the local opinion and why? </p>
        <p>Table = Attraction name, location, type (site, natural attraction etc.), description, best time to visit and entry fee (if applicable)</p>

        <p>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</p>
        <p>= I will plan to obtain information for this project from interviewing my friends and family that currently live in Samoa, information from the STA (Samoa Tourism Authority) website and the rest from the internet. I will use my own photos that I had taken when I lived in Samoa, pictures from the internet(I'll make sure not to get copyrighted photos), references will be to Samoan business websites and or the STA.</p>


        <p>I acknoeledge that I have read the warnings below.</p>
