    <h1>Kaylani</h1>
    <p>A few things that I've grown to love over the years is music, dance and traditions from different areas in the world. I believe this is what initiated my desire to travel the world and explore new places and cultures. England and Spain are a few of the many places I want to visit.</p>

    <p>Another thing that I've only grown to love recently is reading. If I get my hands on a good book you'll probably not hear from me until I've finished it or taken a break from reading. I can typically finish two or three books in a day if I'm not interrupted or if I really like what I'm reading.</p>


    <h2>My top three books that I've read so far this year:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The Right Move - Liz Tomforde</li>
        <li>The Spanish Love Deception - Elena Armas</li>
        <li>Welcome to Hell Boys - Nadine A.T</li>
    </ol>
