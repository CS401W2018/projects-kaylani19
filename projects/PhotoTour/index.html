       <p>For this project, I compiled few places that I've been to as well as places that I have yet to see in New Zealand. The scenery, the culture and the people are beautiful; there are no words or any type of imagery that describe this country's aura and environment. In the related pages, you'll find images of activies or sights to see in different areas of New Zealand. Enjoy!</p>
