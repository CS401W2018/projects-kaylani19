       <h2>My Hero - Taraji P Henson</h2> 
        <p>Someone that I've looked up to for quite a while is Taraji P Henson. 
            There was this one interview that where she was talking about mistakes that really stuck with me saying,
            <span class="highlight">"People make mistakes all the time, if you're gonna love you're gonna love the person for their flaws because we're all flawed and people are gonna make mistakes.
            You're gonna have to go into the relationship knowing that the person is gonna let you down. 
            That's what we do, humans hurt each other; I don't care who you are, your mum, your dad. In some point in life they said or did 
            something that made you feel a kind of way but that's human. And when you talk about loving unconditionally; you gotta love that part."</span>
        </p>

        <p>Taraji's performances in film and television display her versatility and ability she has to beautifully portray a character.
            Her presence in the filming industry is globally recognized. In addition, the strength and power she exudes is something I find inspiring.
            Henson's advocacy for mental health awareness also positively influences me as well as others who look up to her.
