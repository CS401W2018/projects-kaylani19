        <h2>My Interest - Music</h2>

        <h3>Music helps express emotions</h3>
        <p>I like to think that music is a way that many can express deep emotions that individuals find hard to communicate in a simple converstion.
            The ability that artists have to convey feelings and portray their vision through music is truly special.
            No matter the genre; songs or simple instrumental pieces can evoke deep emotions, further connecting people of different races and backgrounds and I think that's a beautiful thing.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Music is therapeutic</h3>
        <p>Speaking of music's ability to foster emotional connections, its power to help heal is unmatched. 
            The potential of a single piece of music to uplift a person's spirits is one of the many reasons why I turn to music during hard times. 
            The way music can help you process your emotions is comforting, which is probably why people often say, 'music is medicine for the soul.'
