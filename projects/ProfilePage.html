    <h1>Hello! My name is Kaylani</h1>
    <p>I'm a freshman who is still figuring things out. I'm currently interested in 
        Information Technology and I have a strong interest in improving any technical skills I can in regards to technology. 
        A couple special characters that I've learnt include the copyright symbol &copy; and the registered trademark symbol &reg;.
        In my free time, I like to work towards earning online badges and build my portfolio.</p>
    
    <p> Apart from learning new technological skills, I enjoy singing to music and binge-watching movies or tv shows. 
        I find comfort in being in my own space, it's rather relaxing and helps me clear my mind after long days of school and work. 
        I am also a really big fan of reading fiction novels, especially ones that have twisted plots and is a part of a series.</p>

        I am <em>very passionate</em> about reading to the point where I can read 3 or 4 books in a day. 
        I'm <strong>dedicated</strong> to improving my skills. 
        I also love <mark>learning</mark> my mistakes because it helps me gain experience from experimenting.
