    <header>
        <h1>Nature</h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
        <a href = "#">Trees</a>
        <a href = "#">Plants</a>
    </nav>

    <main>
        <h1>Trees</h1>
        <figure id = "treepic">
            <img src="tree.jpg" alt ="A simple clipart picture of a tree">
            <figurecaption>An animated version of a tree</figurecaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Notes: This p tag is seen as the middle sibling in this caseand therefore has to share with the younger sibling (the footer). It is best to "float" the figure tag in css. Float "left" or "right" put tags side by side.</p>
        <p>When you use clear, it'll drop everything that is below that "clear:both" tag to be under the sharing space above. Tip: Delete the div tag with the clear both in css to show how this works.</p>
        <p>For project next week, use the navigation tag example above.

            The position relative will basically just slide the image and keep the space. Top, bottom, left and right. Absolute and fixed are almost the same.
