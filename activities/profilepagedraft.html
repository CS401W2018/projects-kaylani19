    <h1>John Doe's Profile</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is John Doe, and I am currently a first-year student in college. 
        I'm studying Computer Science, and I have a strong interest in web development. 
        In my free time, I love learning about new coding languages and experimenting with 
        different web technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from coding, I enjoy playing the guitar and hiking. I find the outdoors refreshing, 
        and it helps me clear my mind after long coding sessions. I am also a fan of science fiction 
        movies, especially ones that explore the concept of artificial intelligence and space exploration.
    </p>
