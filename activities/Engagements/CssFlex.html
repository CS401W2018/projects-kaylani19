        <p>1. What you learned about Flex and CSS.</p>
        <p>= A CSS one-dimensional layout tool like Flex are useful for organizing objects in a row or column and uses stuff like "flex-direction", "flex-wrap", and "justify-content" to adjust layouts based on content size. It is therefore helpful for dynamic layouts that adjust to changes in content.</p>
        
        <p>2. Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</p>
        <p>= It's important to have an accessible website so that it can be easily used by all users, including those with disabilities. This is to ensure that the website meets the different needs like screen reader support or keyboard navigation and ultimately allows the user to have a satisfied experience.</p>

        <p>How do you check for valid CSS? (Don't need to answer this on your engagement.)</p>
        <p>I use the W3C Validator website that we were encouraged to use to validate our html and css.</p>
