        <p>1. What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</p>
        <p>= Positives of hosting your videos on Youtube would be that Youtube allows you to host videos without paying for storage. Another positive is that you can easily embed Youtube videos on your website by copying the embed code provided and that videos are easily accessible to a wide audience since Youtube is a very popular platform.</p>
        <p>= Negatives of hosting videos on Youtube would be that there is a high probability that there will be ads and that some video owners disable embedding, limiting your ability to include specific videos on your website.</p>

        <p>2. What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</p>
        <p>= The most useful thing about the transform property is the rotating element. Rotating is a unique functionality that can't be done easily with other CSS properties.</p>

        <p>3. How do you stay safe online?</p>
        <p>= Ways to stay safe online would be to use secure websites (HTTPS) for transactions or sharing personal information and to avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading files from unsecure sources.</p>

        <p>4. What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</p>
        <p>= I'm not sure, I missed class today because I was stuck in Kahuku. I thought class would remain the same (except for when we have the Thanksgiving days off) and just use the rest of our class time to get help and or advice for our final project</p>
