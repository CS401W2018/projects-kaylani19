        <main>
            <p>1. What is JavaScript? How did it get its name?</p>
            <p>= It was a marketing ploy to name the prgramming language "Javascript". Sun Microsystems played a huge part in popularizing it because the name was similar yet JavaScript was unrelated to their programming language, Java.</p>

            <p>2. What are the two ways you can run JavaScript?</p>
            <p>= <strong>Two ways to run JavaScript:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Browser:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It can be run in the browser, where it interacts with DOM</li>
                            <li>DOM represents HTML elements for example, D stand for Documents (e.g. the HTML file) and O represents objects (e.g. tags or elements in HTML)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Server:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Was said to have been developed within the last decade, where JavaScript can be run outside of the browser using "Node.js"</li>
                            <li>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side programming.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol></p>

            <p>3. What was the most popular front-end js library?</p>
            <p>= Back in the browser wars, the most popular front-end JQuery.js library. After Google chrome came, nobody really used JQuery.js</p>

            <p>4. What is the most popular front-end js library today?</p>
            <p>= The most popular front-end js library is done by Meta, which is the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, they use React.js.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Notes from discussion about engagement for today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is another programming language.</li>

                    <li><strong><em>Reminder!</em></strong> React.js is something that could bring really good job opportunities and would look good on your resume.</li>

                    <li>Javascript runs inside of the browser. Nobody has to download Javascript because it is already within the browser.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Browser Wars:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There two major companies - Microsoft & Sun Microsystems - competed for dominance in web technology.</li>
                            <li>The competition was part of the broader "browser wars" between Netscape and Internet Explorer.</li>
                            <li>Netscape was a popular browser that users had to download, however Internet Explorer came pre-installed on Windows computers, giving it a significant advantage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Linux & Apache:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open-sources like Linux and Apache helped balance the power dispute between Microsoft and Sun Microsystems by providing free and community-driven alternatives.</li>
                            <li>This affected the stock markets for the large companies to plummet</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
