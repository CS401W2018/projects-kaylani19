        <h2>1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h2>
        <p>Block tags take up the full width available and start on a new line. Inline tags, only take up as much space as needed and stay within the flow of the text.</p>
        <div>This is a block element.</div>
        <br>
        <span>This is an inline element.</span>
        
        <h2>2. What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
        <p>Margin is the area outside the border and a border is the area around the padding and content. Padding is the area inside the border, between the content and the border. </p>
        <div class="box">
            This box has margin, border, and padding.
        </div>

        
        <h2>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
        <p>= Pixels</p>        
  
        <h2>4. When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
        <p>The figure tag is used to groups image and the caption together. Here's an example:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="picture.png" alt="Example image" width="200">
            <figcaption>This is an image with a caption.</figcaption>
        </figure>
