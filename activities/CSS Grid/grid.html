        <p>1. How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?</p>
        <p>= 20 - 30 minutes is the time frame that the professor said he believes we should put aside to do our engagement assignment. Ultimately it depends on whether you have grasped the concepts taught during class or if you feel like you need more time to practice.</p> 
        <br>

        <p>2. What should you focus on during class and after class?</p>
        <p>= During class, you should focus on the topics that the teaching is instructing. Additionally, after class you should focus on topics or specific areas that you missed during discussion or don't completely understand.</p>
        <br>

        <p>3. What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</p>
        <p>= A grid is used for a more table like display (two-dimensional layouts) with rows and columns. Whereas flex used for one dimensional layouts, so it can display rows or columns.</p>
        <br>

        <div class ="container">
            <div class="item itemA">Item A</div>
            <div class="item itemB">Item B</div>
            <div class="item itemC">Item C</div>
            <div class="item itemD">Item D</div>
            <div class="item itemE">Item E</div>
            <div class="item itemF">Item F</div>
        </div>


        <p>Notes:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>it's important to make sure that you open and close tags</li>
                <li>1fr means 1 fractional unit. You can use percentages but it is easier and somewhat more convenient to use "fr"</li>
                <li>there are games and other resources that you can use to practice or find more info on grid and flex found in the lecture notes</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
