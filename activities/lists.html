    <h1>Engagement - OL, UL</h1>
    
        <h2>1. What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?</h2>
        <p>= The best way to do this is by following the criteria to ensure that you write the code right. The appearance of the webpage might look nice but if the code doesn't tick all the boxes in the rubric then you'll get deducted points.</p>
    
        <h2>2. When is your project due?</h2>
        <p>Before the deadline, <em>however</em>, it is best to complete it and submit it before class then ask the teacher or TA if it is correct <strong>during</strong> class and then resubmit it for it to be regraded.</p>
    
        <h2>3. What are special entity characters?</h2>
        <p>Special entity characters are a way for web developers to display tags, this is done by using "& lt ;_____& gt ;" </p>
    
        <h2>What is the difference bewteen OL and UL Tags?</h2>
        <p>UL is used to display an unordered list that shows with . Whereas, OL is used to display an ordered list.</p>


    <h1>Class discussion/lecture:</h1>
        <p>Accessibility is important for a webpage accessible for EVERYONE and all different devices.
            <br>
            I think ul stands for "Unordered List" and ol stands for "Ordered list". "li" is the tag that allows bulletpoints/lists. 
            <br><br>
            You should not put anything <strong>BUT</strong> an li tag in it. However, you can put a p tag <strong> within the li tag.</strong>
