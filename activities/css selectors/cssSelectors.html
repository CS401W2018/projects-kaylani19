        <p id = "first">You can only use an ID name once. Each tag can only have one.</p>

        <p class = "second">You can reuse class names as much as you want. Each tag can have many classes.The way you can add classes is by using a space in the definition. That's why it's best not to have a space in the class name.</p>

        <p>A span tag does absolutely nothing if it is on its own. It can be written within a another tag. for example if you want it to display specific text as bold here is how. <span class = "bolder">Blah blah blah blah blah blah</span></p>

        <p>A div tag will cause line braks</p>
